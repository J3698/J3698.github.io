	<p>If it takes 10 minutes to just set up a new blog post, something is probably wrong. Especially if much of that time includes copy-pasting formatting from another post. With that in mind, I recently upgraded my website to use Jekyll.</p>

<p>Jekyll is pretty simple - you write posts in plain text or using markdown, and then you use a theme or create layout files in html to surround that text. If you want, you can even include html in your markdown/plain text posts, although that can tend to defeat the purpose.</p>

<p>To get an idea of what using Jekyll is like, here is my directory structure right now, minus some less relevant files:</p>

<p><strong>_posts/</strong> is where all of the posts go. Each post gets named in a particular way, and at the top of each post there are about 5 lines of setup (author, date, etc).</p>

<p><strong>_layouts/</strong> is where html for the posts and other pages go. Each layout file has a place where content will be inserted.</p>

<p><strong>_includes/</strong> is where common html goes. For example, I might make header.html in _includes, and then include that header in different layout files.</p>

<p><strong>_site/</strong> is a staging area - I don’t mess with anything there.</p>

<p><strong>pics/</strong> is pretty self explanatory - I put pictures there.</p>

<p><strong>_config.yml</strong> can become complicated - it lets me change how certain things are automated.</p>

<p><strong>longboard.html</strong> is a landing page that lists my longboard posts.</p>

<p><strong>website.html</strong> lists my website posts (like this post).</p>

<p><strong>styles.css</strong> contains all the styling I need.</p>

<p><strong>404.html</strong> is where you’ll end up if you visit a nonexistent post.</p>

<p>Last but certainly not least, I learned most of the jekyll I know from Mike Dane - he’s crystal clear, and you’ll find yourself doing things you may have thought weren’t possible in Jekyll in no time:</p>
