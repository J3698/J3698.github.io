		I'm creating a personal website because I think it's a great way to showcase my work. I have three goals for this
		website. First, I want the website to feel professional. Second, I want my articles to read well. Third, I want my
		content to impress.

		<br><br>To make sure the website looked professional, I had to have a custom domain. So I bought a domain
		from Google Domains, and used Github Pages as a host. Curtis Larson has an excellent guide for connecting
		Github Pages and Google Domains, so I followed  <a href="http://www.curtismlarson.com/blog/2015/04/12/github-pages-google-domains/">
		his advice</a>. The only issue with his article is that the ip addresses he lists are out of date - I found newer
		addresses <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain/">here</a>,
		under "configuring A records with your DNS provider." I also benefited greatly from Github's
		<a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages guide</a>. The only thing I had to pay for was the domain
		name (which is pretty much unavoidable), and that was just $12.00 a year.
		<br><br>
		Because I want my articles to read well, there aren't a lot of extras on the website - no ads or widgets.
		The bar at the top of the page is only used to get to the home page. Writing doesn't take up the full width
		of the page, which makes articles easier to read.
		<br><br>
		As for impressing people? The website is a good start, but the rest of my content is yet to come. My next post
		is probably going to be about my electric longboard.
