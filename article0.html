		<b>Motive</b><br><br>
			I'm creating a personal website because I think it's a great way to showcase my work.
		<br><br><b>Goals</b><br><br>
			I want the website to be professional, I want articles to read well, and I want to  impress.
		<br><br><b>How</b><br><br>
			To make sure the website looked professional, I had to have a custom domain. So I bought a domain
			from google domains, and used github pages as a host. Curtis Larson has an excellent guide for connecting
			github pages and google domains, so I followed  <a href="http://www.curtismlarson.com/blog/2015/04/12/github-pages-google-domains/">
			his advice</a>. I also benefited greatly from github's <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages guide</a>.
			The only thing I had to pay for was the domain (which is pretty much unavoidable), and that was just
			$12.00 a year.
			<br><br>
			Because I want articles to read well, there's not a lot on the website. The bar at the top of the page is
			only used to get to the home page, and in general pages are as spare as they can be. Writing doesn't take up
			the full width of the page, and that makes articles easier to read. There are also no extra widgets or ads on
			the pages.
			<br><br>
			As for impressing people? The website is a good start, but the rest of my content is yet to come. My next post
			is probably going to be about my electric longboard.
