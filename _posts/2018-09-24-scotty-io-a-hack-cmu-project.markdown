This past weekend, I got to work on a game at Hack CMU with my friends Woody McCoy, Kushal Dulla, and Arvind Govinday. Here's an excerpt from our project description:

"We wanted to create an '.io' type game that involves multiple players and a leaderboard to keep rank. As we were brainstorming ideas for our game, we reflected on our few weeks spent here at CMU and the week of tests ahead. As we saw more people around us worrying about exams, we wanted to remind our peers not to over obsess over them. We thought the best way to convey a message would be through a mix of comedy and a simple yet addicting game mechanic that can draw people in."

I've used AWS Cloud9, Node.js and Socket.io before, so my biggest contribution was setting up the Cloud9 environment and getting everyone acclimated to Node.js and Socket.io. As I was setting the environment up, the others were working on other parts of the game; everyone was instrumental to getting the project finished in 24 hours.
