I'll admit it - I've fallen in love with LED strips. The goal of this project is to be able to connect via bluetooth to a speaker system. The system's processor will recieve audio data, and then analyze it for beats and other musical features. Next, the system will tell some addressable RGB LED strips what patterns to display, as music comes from the speakers.

For now, I plan to use a Raspberry Pi to recieve bluetooth data and perform necessary processing. The Raspberry Pi will control APA102 LED strips, and will output sound to an OontZ Angle 3.

Once I finish the first prototype, I'll focus on making the reactive lighting more interesting. I'll also focus on streamlining the system - the Raspberry I use might be overkill, and powering the lights might be an issue.
