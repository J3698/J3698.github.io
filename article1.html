		Out of all of the bits and pieces of this electric longboard project,
		working with lights has been one of the most difficult and exciting parts.
		Disclaimer, yes my friend <a href="http://shihaocao.com">Shihao</a> did the
		mechanical assembly for the motor, but still - a lot of longboards have
		nice motors, not a lot of longboard have wicked lights. So let's dive in.
		I've included a list of parts at the end.
		
		<br><br><b>Light Fixture #0</b>
			For my first attempt at attaching lights to the longboard, I cut out small squares of wood 
			using my highschool's bandsaw. Then I hot glued the squares onto the longboard, and
			the lights onto the squares. At first it worked out... but the hot glue connections would
			suddenly come loose.

		<br><b>Light Fixture #1</b>
			Hot glue wasn't working, so I turned to using wood screws. I also replaced some of the wooden
			squares with longer wooden strips, so there was more surface area to attach the lights. To connect
			the wooden pieces to the board, I would drill a pilot hole all the way through the wood and then
			longboard, and then I would drive the wood screws in after.

			Longer pieces of wood I could clamp down before drilling, but the smaller pieces would spin when I
			drilled them down, so I used a clamp to twist them to their correct orientation after they were
			drilled down.

			Sometimes a wood screw would go all the way through the longboard, making for a dangerous point
			that came up through the grip tape, so I ground the points down with a dremel.

		<br><br><b>Applying Velcro</b>
			Cutting Velcro was the messiest part of attaching the lights. After just one cut, Velcro's industrial
			strength adhesive catches in scissors. I used a pair of Cutco Super Shears to start each cut
			of the Velcro, but did the rest of the cut with an X-Acto knife. Before putting velcro on the wooden
			blocks, I cleaned the blocks with rubbing alcohol and let them dry.<br><br>There are two parts to velcro.
			The fuzzy part is called the "loop" side - it resembles a carpet, which is made up of loops. The stiffer side
			is called the "hook" side. Generally the loops pick up trash more easily, and need to be replaced more often
			- so they are put on the side where the Velcro is easier to replace. I thought it would be easier to replace
			the Velcro on the lights, so I put the loops on the lights, and the hooks on the board.

			After that, I was done! Next it was time to perfect programming for the lights.

		<br><b>Parts</b>
		<ul>
			<!--<li><b>Arduino Pro Micro - </b>The arduino controls pretty much everything under the longboard.
				I chose the pro micro because it's small and cheap ($6 on amazon/ebay). It also happens
				to have dedicated TX/RX pins for when software serial doesn't work, but that belongs
				in a different longboard post.<br><img class="list" src="./pics/pro-micro.jpg"></img>
			</li>-->
			<li><b>Wood (~1/2" thick) - </b>This is for mounting the lights. I got some for free from a scrap pile at school,
				and then used part of a bigger plank I'd gotten for $10 at home depot.<br><img class="list" src="./pics/wood.jpg"></img>
			</li>
			<li><b>LED RGB Strip - Addressable, Sealed (1m) (2x) - </b>I got these from sparkfun for $50 total.
				These are WS2812s, with a wire for ground, power, and data. LEDs with two data wires
				(5060 LEDs) will probably play better with other arduino accessories, but check the reviews
				on durability first, and decide if you want your lights to be addressable
				(i.e do you want cool patterns, i.e. yes). <br><img class="list" src="./pics/leds.jpg"></img>

			</li>
			<li><b>1" Self-Drilling Wood-Screws - </b>To connect the light fixtures to the board! I got 100 of these
				from Home Depoot for $8, although I can't find them on the website. It's okay if the screws
				aren't self-drilling.<br><img class="list" src="./pics/screws.jpg"></img>

			</li>
			<li><b>4 ft. x 2 in. Industrial Strength Velcro - </b>This stuff is great, so the $10 is worth being
				able to safely attach and detach your $50 worth of ligts.<br><img class="list" src="./pics/velcro.jpg"></img>

		</ul>
		Parts Total: ~$78
		<br><br><b>Tools</b>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Jig Saw - </b>A bandsaw or even handsaw will work, but you need to be able to cut 1/2" thickwood, so
				I got a Hypertough jigsaw from walmart for only $20.<br><img class="list" src="./pics/jigsaw.jpeg"></img>
			</li>
			<li><b>Electric Drill - </b>If you can drill by hand, congratulations - you'll be connecting 1/2" thick
				pieces of wood together. Again I went with Hypertough, it was the cheapest I saw at Walmart, at $20. Mine
				is corded, cordless drills are generally more expensive.<br><img class="list" src="./pics/drill.jpeg"></img>
			</li>
			<li><b>Drill Bit Set - </b>I only ended up using the 7/64" drill bit and the 1/4" hex drive bit, but I'm sure the
				109 piece drill bit set I got for $13 will come in handy again.<br><img class="list" src="./pics/bits.jpeg"></img>
			</li>
			<li><b>Dremel - </b>I used the Dremel as a grinder and sander. I got it from Walmart for $20.<br><img class="list" src="./pics/dremel.jpeg"></img>
		</ul>
		Tools Total: ~$73
