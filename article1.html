		Out of all of the bits and pieces of this electric longboard project,
		working with lights has been one of the most difficult and exciting parts.
		Disclaimer, yes my friend <a href="http://shihaocao.com">shihao</a> did the
		mechanical assembly for the motor, but still - a lot of longboards have
		nice motors, not a lot of longboard have wicked lights. So let's dive in.
		I've included a list of parts at the end.
		
		<br><br><b>Light Fixture #0</b>
			For my first attempt at attaching lights to the longboard, I cut out small squares of wood 
			using my highschool's bandsaw. Then I hot glued the squares onto the longboard, and
			the lights onto the squares. At first it worked out... but the hot glue connections would
			suddenly come loose.

		<br><br><b>Light Fixture #1</b>
			Hot glue wasn't working, so I turned to using wood screws. I would drill a starter hole all
			the way through the wood and then longboard, and drill the wood screws in after. Sometimes the wood screw
			would go all the way through the longboard, making for a dangerous point that came up through the grip tape,
			so I ground the points down with a dremel.

			</div>
			Instead of squares, I used longer pieces of wood for the straight parts of the fixture - they provided more
			surface area to connect the lights to. The most annoying part here was taking the trucks off to screw in the
			blocks of wood on the far ends of the board.

		<br><br><b>Applying Velcro</b>
			Cutting velcro was the messiest part of the light fixture. The industrial strength adhesive catches in
			scissors, so after one cut, gunk collects on the cutting tool. I used a pair of Cutco Super Shears to start each cut
			of the Velcro, but did the rest of the cut with an X-Acto knife. Before putting velcro on the wooden
			blocks, I cleaned the blocks with rubbing alcohol and let them dry.<br><br>There are two parts to velcro.
			The fuzzy part is called the "loop" side - it resembles loops on a carpet. The stiffer side is called the
			"hook" side. Generally the loops pick up trash more easily, and need to be replaced more often - so they
			are put on the side that is easier to replace. For some reason I thought it would be easier to replace
			the velcro on the lights, so I put the loops on the lights, and the hooks on the board.

			After that, I was done! Next it was time to perfect the light programming

		<br><b>Parts</b>
		<ul>
			<!--<li><b>Arduino Pro Micro - </b>The arduino controls pretty much everything under the longboard.
				I chose the pro micro because it's small and cheap ($6 on amazon/ebay). It also happens
				to have dedicated TX/RX pins for when software serial doesn't work, but that belongs
				in a different longboard post.<br><img class="list" src="./pics/pro-micro.jpg"></img>
			</li>-->
			<li><b>Wood (~1/2" thick) - </b>This is for mounting the lights. I got a bunch of wood for
				free from a scrap pile at school, and then borrowed some more from my sister - I'd bought
				her some earlier for $10 to play around with the jigsaw and sander.<br><img class="list" src="./pics/wood.jpg"></img>
			</li>
			<li><b>LED RGB Strip - Addressable, Sealed (1m) (2x) - </b>I got these from sparkfun for $50 total.
				These are WS2812s, with a wire for ground, power, and data. LEDs with two data wires
				(5060 LEDs) will probably play better with other arduino accessories, but check the reviews
				on durability first, and decide if you want your lights to be addressable
				(i.e do you want cool patterns, i.e. yes). <br><img class="list" src="./pics/leds.jpg"></img>

			</li>
			<li><b>1" Self-Drilling Wood-Screws - </b>To connect the light fixtures to the board! I got 100 of these
				from home depoot for $8, although I can't find them on the website. It's okay if the screws
				aren't self-drilling.<br><img class="list" src="./pics/screws.jpg"></img>

			</li>
			<li><b>4 ft. x 2 in. Industrial Strength Velcro - </b>This stuff is great, so the $10 is worth being
				able to safely attach and detach your $50 worth of ligts.<br><img class="list" src="./pics/velcro.jpg"></img>

		</ul>
		Parts Total: ~$78
		<br><br><b>Tools</b>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Jig Saw - </b>A bandsaw or even handsaw will work, but you need to be able to cut 1/2" thickwood, so
				I got a hypertough jigsaw from walmart for only $20.<br><img class="list" src="./pics/jigsaw.jpeg"></img>

			</li>
			<li><b>Electric Drill - </b>If you can drill by hand, congratulations - you'll be connecting 1/2" thick
				wood together. Again I went with hypertough, it was the cheapest I saw at walmart, at $20. Mine
				is corded, as I don't think I'll have use for a cordless drill any time soon.<br><img class="list" src="./pics/drill.jpeg"></img>
			</li>
			<li><b>Drill Bit Set - </b>I only ended up using one bit to drill starter holes, and the 1/4" hex bit, but I'm
				sure the 109 piece drill bit set I got for $18 will come in handy again.
			</li>
		</ul>
		Tools Total: ~$58
