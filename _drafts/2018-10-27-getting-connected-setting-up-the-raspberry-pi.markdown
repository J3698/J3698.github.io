The first step to hooking up the Raspberry Pi is to ensure that Raspbian is installed on it. If the Pi has NOOBS preinstalled, an option to install Raspbian will be shown once the monitor, mouse and keyboard are hooked up. Otherwise, you can use [these intructions](https://thepi.io/how-to-install-raspbian-on-the-raspberry-pi/) to install Raspbian.

The next step is to plug in a mouse, a keyboard, a display that supports HDMI, a bluetooth dongle, and some way to connect to the internet.

To connect to the internet, you can purchase a wifi dongle (suggested) or use an ethernet cable. I used an ethernet cable because that's what I had on hand. I connected one end of the ethernet cable to my network-enabled laptop, and the other to the Pi. Getting this to work depends on what OS you use - for me I had to go to "wired settings", "IPv4 settings", and then to "connection type", which I changed to "share with other computers"; this will be different for other people.
